# Flight planning tool wip

Current version - Alpha testing version.


### Building
To build locally, ensure that you have podman installed[https://podman-desktop.io/downloads] and WSL if running Windows.

To build and run the application, execute `./scripts/build_and_run_local_dev.ps1` from a terminal.
This will build the container, and start the application with port 8000 forwarded.
You can then access the application locally at `127.0.0.1:8000`.
